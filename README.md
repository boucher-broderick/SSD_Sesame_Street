StoryTeller Studio

Although creative writing is a fun task, what is not fun is figuring out how to save your work. That's why StoryTeller Studio was created. With the help of our web application, you now have a way to enjoy writing without the struggle of having to organize. Each project that you get start gets broken down into simpler peices so that you can focus on your writing. The folder archetecture works as follows:

              Projects
    Chapters            Characters
Chapter Content     Character Content

For each project you create, there will be a chapters list and a characters list. When you choose a chapter or character you are brought to the content screen where you can add text, picutres, videos and other forms of media. With each project being put in the same organized format, all you have to worry about is writing. We are currently on the Beta Release of the applications with features such as exporting and the character list being added as of now.
